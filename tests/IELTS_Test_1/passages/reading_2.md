# The Falkirk Wheel
## A unique engineering achievement 

The Falkirk Wheel in Scotland is the world’s first and only rotating boat lift. Opened in 2002, it is central to the ambitious £84.5 million Millennium Link project, which aimed to restore navigability across Scotland by reconnecting the historic waterways of the Forth & Clyde and Union Canals.

The major challenge of the project lay in the fact that the Forth & Clyde Canal is situated 35 metres below the level of the Union Canal. Historically, the two canals had been joined near the town of Falkirk by a sequence of 11 locks—enclosed sections of canal in which the water level could be raised or lowered—that stepped down across a distance of 1.5 km. This link was dismantled in 1933, breaking the connection between the canals. When the project was launched in 1994, the British Waterways authority was keen to create a dramatic twenty-first-century landmark, which would not only commemorate the Millennium but also stand as a lasting symbol of economic regeneration for the region.

Numerous ideas were submitted for the project, ranging from rolling eggs to tilting tanks, giant seesaws to overhead monorails. The eventual winner was a plan for a huge rotating steel boat lift that became The Falkirk Wheel. Its unique shape is said to have been inspired by multiple sources, both natural and manmade—most notably a Celtic double-headed axe, but also the turning propeller of a ship, the ribcage of a whale, or the spine of a fish.

The various parts of The Falkirk Wheel were constructed and assembled, like one giant toy building set, at Butterley Engineering’s steelworks in Derbyshire, some 400 km from Falkirk. A team there carefully assembled the 1,200 tonnes of steel, fitting the pieces together with a precision of just 10 mm to ensure a perfect final fit. In the summer of 2001, the structure was dismantled and transported on 35 lorries to Falkirk, then reassembled on the ground and finally lifted into position in five large sections by crane. Because the Wheel would need to withstand immense and constantly changing stresses as it rotated, the steel sections were bolted rather than welded together. Over 45,000 bolt holes were matched with their bolts, and each bolt was hand-tightened.

The Wheel consists of two sets of opposing axe-shaped arms, attached about 25 metres apart to a fixed central spine. Between the ends of these arms are two diametrically opposed water-filled gondolas, each with a capacity of 360,000 litres. These gondolas always weigh the same, whether or not they are carrying boats. This is because, according to Archimedes’ principle of displacement, floating objects displace their own weight in water. When a boat enters a gondola, the amount of water displaced weighs exactly the same as the boat, keeping the Wheel balanced. Despite its enormous mass, the structure rotates smoothly through 180 degrees in five and a half minutes, while using very little power. In fact, it requires only 1.5 kilowatt-hours (5.4 MJ) of energy to complete a rotation—roughly the same as boiling eight small kettles of water.

Boats that need to be lifted up enter the canal basin at the level of the Forth & Clyde Canal and move into the lower gondola of the Wheel. Two hydraulic steel gates are raised to seal the gondola off from the basin, and the water between the gates is pumped out. A hydraulic clamp, which prevents the arms of the Wheel from moving while the gondola is docked, is then released, allowing the Wheel to turn. In the central machine room, an array of ten hydraulic motors begins to rotate the central axle, which in turn drives the outer arms of the Wheel. The Wheel rotates at a steady speed of one-eighth of a revolution per minute.

As the Wheel turns, the gondolas remain upright thanks to a simple but clever gearing system. Two eight-metre-wide cogs orbit a fixed inner cog of the same width, connected by two smaller cogs that rotate in the opposite direction, ensuring that the gondolas always remain level. When the gondola reaches the top, the boat passes directly onto an aqueduct situated 24 metres above the canal basin.

The remaining 11 metres of elevation needed to reach the Union Canal is achieved by means of a pair of locks. The Wheel could not be built to span the entire 35-metre difference between the two canals due to the presence of the historically important Antonine Wall, a Roman defensive fortification built in the second century AD. Boats pass beneath this wall through a tunnel, ascend the locks, and finally continue on to the Union Canal.
